<h2>Open Seat For Two</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A 3 round fighter to keep your reservation for dinner.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to enjoy this V-day themed game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The gane is fighter.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The Player moves side to side using the left/right keys. The Player can fight by punching(Q) and kicking(W) as well as Dodge(E) in order to fight off the challenger.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I am prototyping how to better use sprites and animations. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The features of my game are just the generic features of a fighting game. You have an attack, a dodge, and a move. I would say that the feature that sets my game apart would be the story and art style.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting of the game is at The Amoureux restaurant.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
It is Valentine's Day, you and your sweetheart have just walked into your favorite restaurant which you happen to have reservations at.
 When you are being seated, another couple is shown to the same table. Apparently the restaurant had doubled reserved the same table. 
 You have to keep your lady happy, so get ready to fight for your table!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is for anyone taking their other out for dinner and runs into issues 
 or anyone else that wants to beat up a virtual guy.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
2-5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Give him the 1, 2, Punch! Also don't forget to use and abuse your ninja skills of a dodge.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created all my assets myself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game resembles most fighting games, 1v1 and 3 rounds.
</li>
